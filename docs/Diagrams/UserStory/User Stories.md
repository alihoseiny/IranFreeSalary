# User Stories

We are using a table instead of cards for writing user stories. Because it's more convenient in Markdown :). Plus that reminds us that user stories should be very short. So keeping it in a table with three rows seems a good idea.

# User story cheat-sheet

You can take a look at this [short guide](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/), but for having a cheat shit here, don't forget that each user story should has following properties:

- **Independent**: Should be self-contained in a way that allows to be released without depending on one another.

- **Negotiable**: Only capture the essence of user's need, leaving room for conversation. User story should not be written like contract. 
- **Valuable**: Delivers value to end user.
- **Estimable**: User stories have to able to be estimated so it can be properly prioritized and fit into sprints.
- **Small**: A user story is a small chunk of work that allows it to be completed in about 3 to 4 days.
- **Testable**: A user story has to be confirmed via pre-written acceptance criteria.

# How to use this document

Each row in the table is a separate user story. We summarized the hard work of writing each story following the pattern and decided to save the poor little planet by saving some bytes. So you only need to fill the role, action and benefit in each row.

## tables

We have two tables in this document. First is the list of roles and their descriptions. Second table is the main table that stores user stories.

You should Always be sure about those two tables are synchronous!
